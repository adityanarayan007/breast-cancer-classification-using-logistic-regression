Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial to increase the chances of effective treatment and recovery. However, manual analysis of imaging tests can be time-consuming and prone to human error. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop automated systems that can assist doctors in detecting and classifying breast lesions.

To develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify whether a breast tissue sample obtained through fine needle aspiration (FNA) is benign or malignant based on features extracted from cell nucleus images. This model will help speed up the diagnostic process and improve accuracy, providing a reliable second opinion for doctors.

The dataset used is the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)" available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 569 samples with 30 features extracted from cell nucleus images, as well as the diagnosis (benign or malignant).

This is a simple implementation of Logistic Regression algorithm.
